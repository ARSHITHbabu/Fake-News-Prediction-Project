# Fake-News-Prediction-Project
A project based on  Fake News Prediction which utilizes machine learning to analyze textual features and classify news articles as either genuine or fake.Fake News Prediction projects are essential for addressing the growing challenge of misinformation. These projects contribute to building tools that can assist in identifying and mitigating the impact of fake news, thereby fostering a more informed public discourse.

**GETTING STARTED**

1)*IMPORTING THE LIBRARIES*:
At first we have to imports essential Python libraries for text analysis and machine learning.It includes NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, NLTK for natural language processing, Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks such as text vectorization and linear regression modeling.

      1)NumPy (np): It is a library for numerical operations in Python which provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions.

      2)Pandas (pd): It is a data manipulation library which provides data structures like DataFrames, that are useful for handling and analyzing structured data.

      3)Re (re): This is a regular expression module in Python which is used for pattern matching and manipulation of strings.

      4)NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A library for working with human language data. It includes various tools for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more.

      5)Seaborn (sns): A data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing an interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

      6)Matplotlib.pyplot (plt): Matplotlib is a 2D plotting library for Python and Pyplot is a module within Matplotlib that provides a convenient interface for creating various types of plots.

      7)Stopwords: A module from NLTK that contains a list of common words (e.g., "we," "must," "our") that are often removed from text data during preprocessing because they don't contribute much to the meaning.

      8)PorterStemmer: It is a stemming algorithm from NLTK which is used to reduce words to their root/base form and it helps in normalizing words and reducing dimensionality in text data.

      9)TfidfVectorizer: A class from scikit-learn used for converting a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features. TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and is commonly used in text analysis.

      10)Train-test split (train_test_split): A function from scikit-learn that splits a dataset into training and testing sets, which is crucial for evaluating machine learning models.

      11)LogisticRegression: It is a class from scikit-learn which is used for logistic regression.It is also a common algorithm for binary classification tasks.

      12)Accuracy_score: A function from scikit-learn for computing the accuracy of a classification model.


2)*IMPORTING THE DATA SETS*:
Here,we are going to import 2 datasets from kaggle which is needed for the project.The 2 datasets are Fake.csv and True.csv.Here we can execute commands specifying the respective Kaggle dataset paths for each and use Pandas to read them into DataFrames in your Colab environment.


3)*EDA (exploratory data analysis*:
